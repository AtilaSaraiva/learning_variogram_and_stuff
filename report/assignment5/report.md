Code to generate the results can be found on the github repository [https://github.com/AtilaSaraiva/learning_variogram_and_stuff](https://github.com/AtilaSaraiva/learning_variogram_and_stuff/blob/fff8841c758a461fbd223c40c46c5b8fea1df236/src/assingment.ipynb)

# Question 1

By analysing the variogram map, the major direction of continuity is $N45^o$ and the minor is the minor is $N315^o$, perpendicular to the major direction.

Figure 1 shows the experimental variogram plot for the major and minor directions.

In order to make the model for each direction, the gaussian function was chosen since the variograms have low values for small
lags. The function ended up being

$$\gamma_{major}(h) = 0.1042 + 0.2883\,Gauss(h, a=35) + 0.2998\,Gauss(h, a=50) + 0.3077\,Gauss(h, a=60)$$

$$\gamma_{minor}(h) = 0.1136 + 0.2935\,Gauss(h, a=20) + 0.2935\,Gauss(h, a=20) + 0.2995\,Gauss(h, a=50)$$

Figure 2 shows a plot of the modeled variogram versus the experimental variogram values.

# Question 2

The calculated values for the moment of inertia were:

$I_{xx}=34, I_yy=54, I_xy=-288$

and

$\theta = {-44^o, 46}$
